# Members Only!

-  I built an exclusive clubhouse app where the members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it, using Ruby on Rails

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Adding gems for extra features
